# excel2R
a repository of how to "translate" everyday excel and sql stuff into R. it's intended to help analysts who venture into 
coding with the basics of exploring, transforming and performing basic analytics with data in R from a view point of 
someone who thinks in spreadsheet or sql terms rather than coming from a coding or statistics languages related backround.
